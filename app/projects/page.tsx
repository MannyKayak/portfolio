                Clean Steps is a small game I developed for the Reddit
                Hackathon. Itâ€™s a unique guessing game where one player
                strategically places ðŸ’© along a path in a park, and the other
                must find the correct route while avoiding these obstacles. I
                built the game using the Devvit SDK with TypeScript, and I
                created all the sprites and artwork in my own pixel art style.

                  This is a presonal project I'm still working on, I made an
                  Arduino sensor to measure movements of the boat, together with
                  this I made an instrument to measure power on gym exercises,
                  the aim is to find relationships between the two elements. To
                  develop I'm using Arduino IDE (C++) and Python to develope the
                  GUI to manage the data on PC.

                  Avandra was a small startup that I joined as full stack dev,
                  it was an AI agent able to manage user needs douring travels.
                  It was developed with React Native, JavaScript using Node and
                  Firebase as backend.
